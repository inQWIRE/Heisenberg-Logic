# Heisenberg-Foundations
The basics of the Heisenberg representation of quantum computing

### Mathematical Foundations

- Preamble : Mathematical definitions and lemmas.

- LinAlg : Result about linear algebra.

- F2Math : Math on the finite field of characteristic 2.

### Hoare-Heisenberg Logic

- Predicates : Definition and properties of stabilizer predicates.

- Normalization : Functions and lemmas for normalization.

- HoareHeisenbergLogic : Main file that contains the core logic of Hoare-Heisenberg Logic.

- Separability : Definition and lemmas about separability.

- Automation : Definitions and tactics for automation.

- Examples : A collection of verified programs.

This project is based on [Hoare meets Heisenberg: A Lightweight Logic for Quantum Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.08939v4) by Aarthi Sundaram, Robert Rand, Kartik Singhal, and Brad Lackey.

This repository depends on the external library QuantumLib (https://github.com/inQWIRE/QuantumLib).

This repository was developed and tested for Coq 8.19.2.
